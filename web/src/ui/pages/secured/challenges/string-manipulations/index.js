// TODO Challenge 4

// Create a parent container component
//    Have an input that will take a phrase and pass it's value down to its two children (save the input data to redux-saga state tree)
//    Have two children components (make the folders here)
//        One that will show the reverse of the string
//            This component should have a radio input that will change the direction from being normal to reverse (only use props & comp state)
//            It should effect both it's output but also the output for the filtered component
//        One that will filter out characters from the string
//            This component will have an additional input that will be used to filter characters (only use props & comp state)

# bh-challenge-4
This is a challenge that we will continue to work on throughout the class
you will be graded on checkpoints as we progress. Make sure to follow all of the instructions and to push your changes up to your branch as we will be pulling down from your branch, running tests, and comparing your results.

### Challenges

(Login creds for now are ```username - bryce@helio.com  password - 123```)
1. Look for all of the TODO comments and complete them.
    - Additionally all pages must have two layouts. One for mobile and one for everything else (use media queries)

### Fork this project
1. Add your team members to the repo
1. Have everyone clone this repo down
1. Create a branch per team member ```<lastname>/<firstname>-<feature>```
    - ```git checkout -b hayden/bryce-finish-login-page```
1. Make some changes and commit your work
    - ```git status``` (to see changes)
    - ```git add .``` (to add all changes)
    - ```git commit -m "<yourmessage>"```
1. Push your branch up
    - ```git push origin <nameOfBranch> -u``` (only do it this way for the first time)
    - ```git push``` (do it this way all other times)
1. We will grade off of the master branch so your team must coordinate and merge your branches regularly

### Running the project
1. Make sure you have Docker CE installed
1. Open up your terminal
1. cd into the project
